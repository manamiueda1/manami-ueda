I'm Manami, a full-stack software engineer based in New York City. Originally from Chicago, I began my career in the tech industry as a Product Manager for a mobile application development company.

Since then, I\\u2019ve hungered for more opportunities and decided that a move to New York City would further build my skills in business. Now holding three years of experience from the technology industry, I\\u2019ve realized that a company that places emphasis on an ethical and respectful environment, hold the best results in both employment and consumer revenue. This knowledge has served me beneficially in every sales team I have become a part of. However, sales was not enough for me\\u2014I wanted to form a deeper understanding of the technology I was selling and create a more authentic bond between the product and the customer, which then led me to enroll into a coding and computer science program. Now a recent graduate from Fullstack Academy, I have enhanced my knowledge on what it means to be a part of how a product is developed and the incredible feeling that comes with helping others understand the product from the ground up.
