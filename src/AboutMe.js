        Hi! I'm Manami, a full-stack software engineer based in New York City.
        Originally from Chicago, I began my career in the tech industry as a
        Product Manager for a mobile application development company. Shortly
        after that, I moved to New York City and joined an AdTech company as a
        Platform Sales Rep. I wanted to form a deeper understanding of the
        technology I was selling and create a more authentic bond between the
        product and the customer, which then led me to enroll in Fullstack
        Academy's Software Engineering Immersive Program. Now a recent graduate
        from Fullstack Academy, I have enhanced my knowledge on what it means to
        be a part of how a product is developed and the incredible feeling that
        comes with helping others understand the product from the ground up.
        That aside, when Iâ€™m not coding, I can be found doing inversions in the
        yoga studio or whipping up new recipes in the kitchen.
