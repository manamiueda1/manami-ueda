        For Manami Ueda, ethics is the central feature of her business mindset.
        A three-year veteran of the tech industry, Manami knows that when a
        company is ethical and respectful to its customers and employees, that
        its business thrives. She brings that knowledge to everything she does,
        whether it be coding, human resources, or advertising. A former
        assistant director for a mobile application development company in
        Chicago, Manami was also an integral part of an advertising technology
        company in New York. Furthermore, she is a recent graduate of Fullstack
        Academy, which bolstered her business savvy with incredible in-sights
        into coding and computer science. For Manami, the most exciting part of
        coding is seeing the results of what she is building â€“ of witnessing
        people interact with programs and processes that she designed.
